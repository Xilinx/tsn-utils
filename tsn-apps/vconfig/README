       rem             [vlan-name]

       set_flag        [interface-name] [flag-num]       [0 | 1]

* The [interface-name] is the name of the ethernet card that hosts

  the VLAN you are talking about.

* The vlan_id is the identifier (0-4095) of the VLAN you are operating on.

* skb_priority is the priority in the socket buffer (sk_buff).

* vlan_qos is the 3 bit priority in the VLAN header

* name-type:  VLAN_PLUS_VID (vlan0005), VLAN_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD (vlan5),

              DEV_PLUS_VID (eth0.0005), DEV_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD (eth0.5)

* bind-type:  PER_DEVICE  # Allows vlan 5 on eth0 and eth1 to be unique.

              PER_KERNEL  # Forces vlan 5 to be unique across all devices.

* FLAGS:  1 REORDER_HDR  When this is set, the VLAN device will move the

            ethernet header around to make it look exactly like a real

            ethernet device.  This may help programs such as DHCPd which

            read the raw ethernet packet and make assumptions about the

            location of bytes.  If you don't need it, don't turn it on, because

            there will be at least a small performance degradation.  Default

            is OFF.
